# 🇰🇷 K-Nator  
*A Cute & Realistic Korean Name Generator*  

---

## 🌸 Overview  
K-Nator is a **fun, responsive, and Korean-style web app** that generates authentic Korean names.  
It works in **two modes**:  

1. **Random Korean Name** → Generates a name based on real-life Korean naming conventions, with gender choice.  
2. **Get My Korean Name** → Enter your own name + gender, and K-Nator creates a Korean-adapted version just for you.  

Each result includes:  
- **Hangul (Korean characters)** in a Korean-style font.  
- **Romanization** (using Revised Romanization).  
- **Meaning of each syllable** (via built-in dictionary).
